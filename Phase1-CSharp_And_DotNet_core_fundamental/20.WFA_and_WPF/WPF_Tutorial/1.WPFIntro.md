# Introduction to WPF

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is Microsoft’s modern UI framework for building Windows desktop 
applications. Unlike WinForms, WPF uses XAML, an XML-based declarative language, to define user interfaces 
separately from application logic.

WPF uses a vector-based, hardware-accelerated rendering engine and is resolution-independent, making it easy to 
support high-DPI and modern graphics.

WPF is part of .NET, and today there are two implementations: the original .NET Framework 4.x WPF(Windows-only) 
and the open-source WPF on .NET (Core), available in .NET 5/6/7/8 and later.
Both can be used in Visual Studio (VS2019/2022+), though the modern .NET version uses SDK-style projects and 
NuGet package references (while .NET Framework used packages.config).

Most WPF development happens in Visual Studio. You create a new WPF Application project (choosing .NET 6/7/8 
or .NET Framework 4.x as needed), which generates a Window defined in XAML and a C# code-behind. This split 
between XAML (for UI layout) and C# (for behavior) is fundamental: it reduces coupling and lets designers and 
developers work in parallel.

# Winform vs WPF 

| Aspect                   | WinForms             | WPF                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| UI Definition            | Imperative (C# code) | Declarative (XAML)     |
| Rendering                | GDI+ (pixel-based)   | DirectX (vector-based) |
| Architecture             | Event-driven         | Data-driven            |
| Separation of UI & Logic | Weak                 | Strong (MVVM)          |

1. UI Creation Style\
> WinForms

Button btn = new Button();
btn.Text = "Save";
btn.Click += Btn_Click;
this.Controls.Add(btn);

UI is created in code (or designer generates code).

> WPF
<Button Content="Save" Command="{Binding SaveCommand}" />

UI is written in XAML, behavior comes from binding, not events.
Advantage WPF: Clean UI logic separation

2. Layout System (Very Important)

WinForms

- Fixed positioning
- Anchor / Dock
- Breaks easily on resize & DPI scaling

WPF

- Dynamic layout panels:
    * StackPanel
    * Grid
    * DockPanel
- Auto resizing
- DPI independent

Advantage WPF: Professional, responsive UI

3. Data Binding (Game Changer)
> WinForms
textBox1.Text = user.Name;

Manual update everywhere.

> WPF
<TextBox Text="{Binding UserName}" />

- Automatic updates
- Two-way binding
- Minimal glue code

Advantage WPF (huge for business apps)

4. Architecture & Maintainability

| Feature                   | WinForms | WPF       |
| ------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| MVVM Support              | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes     |
| Unit Testing UI Logic     | Hard     | Easy      |
| Large App Maintainability | Poor     | Excellent |

Advantage WPF for large, long-term projects

5. Styling & Customization
> WinForms

- Limited styling
- Custom drawing required

> WPF

- Styles
- Templates
- Themes
- Resource dictionaries

e.g : 

<Style TargetType="Button">
  <Setter Property="Background" Value="Blue"/>
</Style>

One style → whole app
Advantage WPF

6. Performance & Graphics

| Area        | WinForms   | WPF             |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Rendering   | CPU (GDI+) | GPU (DirectX)   |
| DPI Scaling | Poor       | Excellent       |
| Animations  | Hard       | Built-in        |
| Graphics    | Limited    | 2D / 3D / Media |

Note : 

- WPF for dashboards, charts, animations
- WinForms still faster for very simple forms

7. When to Choose What?

Choose WinForms if:

- App is very small
- Maintenance of legacy project
- Simple CRUD internal tool
- Time is extremely limited

Choose WPF if:

- New project
- Medium / large application
- Long-term maintenance
- Need clean architecture
- Dashboard / charts / rich UI

# Suggested Learning Path (Fast Transition)

1️⃣ WinForms vs WPF mental shift
2️⃣ XAML basics
3️⃣ Layout panels (Grid is king 👑)
4️⃣ Data binding
5️⃣ MVVM + ICommand
6️⃣ DataGrid + business forms
7️⃣ Deployment (MSIX / ClickOnce)
